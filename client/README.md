# Jenin client (minimal)

This is a minimal static client to interact with the Express backend.

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Click "Check Backend Health" to verify the backend.
- Type a question and click "Ask" to hit the placeholder interview endpoint.

Later we can replace this with a proper framework (e.g., Next.js) and add WebSocket/Socket.IO support for streaming STT and responses.
